# Becoming

> A jar for who you're becoming.

Becoming is a quiet journaling app built around a simple idea - identity change is incremental. Instead of a blank page or a daily habit, you capture small moments when you acted like the person you're growing into. Each note is crumpled and dropped into a jar. Over time, the jar fills with evidence that you're already becoming who you want to be.

Built with SwiftUI and SpriteKit for Apple Swift Student Challenge 2026.
